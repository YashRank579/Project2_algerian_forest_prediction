# Project2_algerian_forest_prediction
A machine learning project on the Algerian Forest Fires dataset involving data cleaning, visualization, and regression modeling using Lasso, Ridge, and ElasticNet.
# Algerian Forest Fires Regression Analysis 🌲🔥

This project analyzes the **Algerian Forest Fires dataset** using machine learning techniques to model and predict fire occurrences based on meteorological and regional features. The analysis includes **data cleaning**, **visualization**, and **regression modeling** using **Lasso**, **Ridge**, and **ElasticNet**—along with their **cross-validated versions**.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

| Model              | Regularization | Cross-Validated Version |
|-------------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| Lasso             | ✅              | ✅ (`LassoCV`)           |
| Ridge             | ✅              | ✅ (`RidgeCV`)           |
| ElasticNet        | ✅              | ✅ (`ElasticNetCV`)      |

Each model is evaluated using:
- **R² Score**
